# 90 Days of CSS

Inspired by Jenifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in), only i'm being more specific with CSS stuff only and doing it for 90 days (3 months).

Wish me luck and/or join me!

Starting date: April 2, 2017

I am:
- Learning and building CSS things
- Committing code to Github every day
- Not worrying about perfection

The goal is to master CSS topics, understand them completely and try everything i learn. By the end of 90 days i want to feel pretty damn confident calling myself a CSS wizard! No imposter syndrome, because this will serve as proof of my capabilities.
