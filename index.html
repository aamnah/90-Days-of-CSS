        <h1>90 Days of CSS</h1>

        <p>Inspired by Jenifer Dewalt's <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in">180 websites in 180 days</a>, only i'm being more specific with CSS stuff only and doing it for 90 days (3 months).</p>

        <p>Wish me luck and/or join me!</p>

        <p>Starting date: April 2, 2017</p>

        <p>
          I am:
          <ul>
            <li>Learning and building CSS things</li>
            <li>Committing code to Github every day</li>
            <li>Not worrying about perfection</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The goal is to master CSS topics, understand them completely and try everything i learn. By the end of 90 days i want to feel pretty damn confident calling myself a CSS wizard! No imposter syndrome, because this will serve as my proof of capabilities.</p>
